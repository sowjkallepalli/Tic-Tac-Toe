# Tic-Tac-Toe
AI vs AI Tic Tac Toe game with Minmax search


This project is a Python-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where two AI agents play against each other using the Minimax algorithm.

The game demonstrates AI decision-making in a strategic board game.

ðŸ”¹ **Key Features**
Minimax Algorithm: The AI computes the best move by evaluating future game states.
AI vs AI Gameplay: The game is fully automated, with both X and O controlled by Minimax-based AI.
Randomized First Move: The first move is chosen randomly to introduce variation.

ðŸ”¹** How It Works**
The game board is displayed after each move.
The AI agents take turns making the best possible move.
The game runs until a player wins or the board results in a draw.
